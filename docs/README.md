# Project Docs — realtime-collaboration-editor

This `docs/` folder contains phase-by-phase documentation describing the work performed on the project, the rationale behind architectural choices, how to run and test the code, and lessons learned.

Phases available:

- [PHASE 1 — Backend Skeleton & Real-Time Foundation](./PHASE-1.md)

How to use these docs

- Read `PHASE-1.md` to understand why the backend was set up first, how to run it, and what the next phases should cover.
- When additional phases are added they will be linked here.

If you'd like the docs converted to a single `README.md` at project root, or exported as a developer blog post, let me know and I will generate the required format.
