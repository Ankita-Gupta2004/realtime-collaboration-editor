# Project Docs — realtime-collaboration-editor

This `docs/` folder contains phase-by-phase documentation describing the work performed on the project, the rationale behind architectural choices, how to run and test the code, and lessons learned.

Phases available:

- [PHASE 1 — Backend Skeleton & Real-Time Foundation](./PHASE-1.md)
- [PHASE 2 — Frontend Skeleton (React)](./PHASE-2.md)
- [PHASE 3 — Documents & Rooms (Scoping Collaboration)](./PHASE-3.md)
- [PHASE 4 — CRDT (Yjs Integration)](./PHASE-4.md)
- [PHASE 5 — Persistence & Database](./PHASE-5.md)

How to use these docs

- Read each `PHASE-*.md` to understand the decisions, code snippets, and run instructions for that phase.
- Use the Phase Overview as a guided onboarding for the repository.

If you'd like the docs converted to a single `README.md` at project root, or exported as a developer blog post, let me know and I will generate the required format.
